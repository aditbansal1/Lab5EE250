# Question 5: In the Windows case, why do we need to convert the signal quality to dBm?

# Question 6: What is the standard deviation? Why is it useful to calculate it?

# Question 8: Why is it important to plot the error bars? What do they tell us?

# Question 9: What did you observe from the plot? How does the signal strength change as you move between locations?
    #         Why do you think signal strength is weaker in certain locations?


The bathroom showed the strongest signal strength around -41dBm, while the hallway showed the weakest around -65dBm. Signal strength generally decreased as distance from the router increased or when more walls were present. The error bars indicate that some locations experienced more fluctuation in signal strength, likely due to interference or physical barriers such as walls and plumbing. This confirms that WiFi signal degrades with distance and obstacles.
